# Tyler's Game of War
For this project we were required to replicate the card game __War__ using __JavaScript__.

In the card game __War__, a main deck of 52 card is shuffled and then distributed evenly  
between two players. Each player will start with __26__ cards. The game starts by  
each player drawing the __first__ card from the top of their deck and placing it face up  
next to the opposite players card. __Whoever has the card of the higher values wins.__
